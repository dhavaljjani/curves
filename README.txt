(3) The code-grader URL for full-res images on the standalone grader

(4) There is no image grader for this assignment, leave this blank.  

(5) The curves2.cpp file within the "hw-curves" directory.

(6) Regular compilation instructions.

(7) The Bezier2 recursive definition doesn't work. If you uncomment the (*it).draw() in the accumulateNextLevel() function though, all the correct points for the Bezier curve are formed. I think my sorting of points into the left and right is incorrect but I can't figure it out, along with the adding lines between them. Also, for some reason the aurograder is showing the Bezier1 curve for my implementation as different to what it outputs, when I test those points out manually I get the correct solution as shown by Solution, like for the 2nd and 4th photo.
